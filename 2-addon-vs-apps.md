### Understanding Splunk Add-Ons vs. Apps

**Splunk Add-Ons:**
- Add-ons are used to extend the capabilities of Splunk. They typically include inputs, knowledge objects, and field extractions that are specific to certain types of data or sources.
- They don't generally have user interfaces but provide essential functions to collect, parse, and enrich data.
- Add-ons are installed on the forwarders, indexers, and search heads depending on their function.
- Example: The Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk Enterprise (TA-cisco_ios) sets the correct sourcetype and fields used for identifying data from Cisco devices (e.g., IOS, IOS XE, IOS XR, NX-OS, WLAN Controllers, and Access Points).

**Splunk Apps:**
- Apps are more comprehensive and often include dashboards, reports, and visualizations.
- They may also include the same data inputs and knowledge objects as add-ons, but with an added user interface for analysis and reporting.
- Apps are typically installed on search heads where users interact with them.
- Example: A Cisco Networks App might include dashboards and reports for visualizing the data collected by the Cisco Networks Add-on.

### Example: Cisco Networks Add-On for Splunk Enterprise

The Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk Enterprise (TA-cisco_ios) is designed to help you integrate data from Cisco devices into Splunk. Here are some key details from the document you provided:

- **Purpose:** Sets the correct sourcetype and fields for identifying data from various Cisco devices, including IOS, IOS XE, IOS XR, NX-OS, WLAN Controllers, and Access Points.
- **Installation:** Install this Add-On on your search head and indexers/heavy forwarders.
- **Supported Devices:** Includes Cisco Catalyst series switches, ASR routers, ISR routers, Nexus Data Center switches, Carrier Routing Systems, Metro Ethernet, Industrial Ethernet, Blade Switches, Connected Grid, Access Points, and WLAN Controllers.
- **Compatibility:** Compatible with various versions of Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud (versions 9.2, 9.1, 9.0, 8.2, 8.1).
- **Usage:** Used for normalizing and enriching data to make it CIM (Common Information Model) compliant.

### Steps to Install and Configure the Cisco Networks Add-On

1. **Download the Add-On:**
   - From Splunkbase: [Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk Enterprise](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467)

2. **Install the Add-On:**
   - On your Splunk search head and indexers/heavy forwarders, install the Add-On by navigating to `Manage Apps > Install app from file` and upload the downloaded file.

3. **Configure the Add-On:**
   - After installation, configure the Add-On to collect data from your Cisco devices.
   - Ensure that your Cisco devices are configured to send syslog data to your Splunk forwarders.

4. **Set Up Data Inputs:**
   - Configure the necessary data inputs (e.g., syslog) to receive data from the Cisco devices.
   - Ensure the data is correctly sourcetyped and indexed.

5. **Install the Cisco Networks App (if available):**
   - If there is a corresponding app for visualizing the data, install it on your search head to leverage pre-built dashboards and reports.

This Add-On provides the groundwork for Splunk to properly parse and normalize data from Cisco devices, making it easier to analyze and visualize within Splunk.

### Understanding the Cisco Networks Add-On vs. Cisco Networks App

Based on the provided documents, here’s a distinction between the Cisco Networks Add-On and the Cisco Networks App for Splunk:

**Cisco Networks Add-On:**
- **Purpose:** Primarily used to set the correct sourcetype and fields for data from Cisco devices. It ensures that the data is parsed and normalized correctly for Splunk.
- **Installation:** Install on search heads and indexers/heavy forwarders.
- **Functionality:** It doesn’t provide dashboards or visualizations but prepares the data for indexing and search.

**Cisco Networks App:**
- **Purpose:** Provides dashboards, data models, and logic for analyzing data from Cisco devices. It leverages the data parsed by the Cisco Networks Add-On.
- **Installation:** Install on the search head.
- **Functionality:** Offers pre-built dashboards, visualizations, and reports to help analyze and interpret the data from Cisco devices.

### Installation Steps for Beginners

Since this is your first time using Splunk, I recommend installing both the Cisco Networks Add-On and the Cisco Networks App. The Add-On will ensure your data is correctly ingested and parsed, and the App will provide you with the visual tools to analyze that data.

#### Step 1: Install the Cisco Networks Add-On

1. **Download the Add-On:**
   - From Splunkbase: [Cisco Networks Add-on for Splunk Enterprise](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1467)

2. **Install the Add-On:**
   - Log in to your Splunk Web interface.
   - Go to `Manage Apps > Install app from file`.
   - Upload the downloaded file and install it.
   - Ensure the Add-On is installed on both your search heads and indexers/heavy forwarders.

3. **Configure the Add-On:**
   - After installation, configure the Add-On to collect data from your Cisco devices.
   - Ensure your Cisco devices are configured to send syslog data to your Splunk forwarders.

#### Step 2: Install the Cisco Networks App

1. **Download the App:**
   - From Splunkbase: [Cisco Networks App for Splunk Enterprise](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1352)

   - Configure the input to listen for syslog data from your Cisco devices.

### Ensure Data is Being Collected

3. **Configure Your Cisco Devices to Send Logs:**
   - On your Cisco IOS device, configure syslog to send logs to your Splunk forwarder:
     ```sh
     configure terminal
     logging host <Splunk_Forwarder_IP> transport udp port 514
     logging trap informational
     end
     write memory
     ```
   - Replace `<Splunk_Forwarder_IP>` with the IP address of your Splunk forwarder.

### Verify Data Ingestion

4. **Check Data in Splunk:**
   - Go to `Search & Reporting` in the Splunk navigation bar.
   - Perform a search to ensure data from your Cisco devices is being ingested:
     ```sh
     index=* sourcetype="cisco:ios"
     ```

### Install Cisco Networks App (Optional)

5. **Download and Install the Cisco Networks App:**
   - If you want dashboards and visualizations, download the Cisco Networks App for Splunk from [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1352).
